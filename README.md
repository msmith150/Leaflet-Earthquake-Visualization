# leaflet-challenge

For the first part of this challenge, I created a map, using Leaflet, that plotted all the earthquakes tracked by USGS during the past 24 hours (ref: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson) based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color, which is also shown in the legend. The size of the circles on the map denote differences in magnitude; those with higher magnitude appear larger.  Clicking on any point (earthquake) will generate a pop-up the provides information regarding the selected earthquakes location, magnitude, and depth as well as a hyperlink to a USGS page with more information about the earthquake.

For the second part of the challenge, I modified the map to include tectonic plate boundary information converted by Hugo Ahlenius and chanbot5000 from the dataset originally published in the paper _An updated digital model of plate boundaries_ by Peter Bird (Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems, 4(3), 1027, [doi:10.1029/2001GC000252] and provided via Github (https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json?short_path=43acb58).  I also added satellite and grayscale basemaps as well as the ability to turn on/off layers.


To assist in the creation of this map, I utilized materials from the DU Data Bootcamp, ChatGPT, Leaflet reference documents, and Brave AI query.
